# mod11_challenge
This repository is for the edX Data Analytics and Visualization bootcamp affiliated with Case Western Reserve University. The assignmnet in this repo is for module 11 of the bootcamp, focused on data collection and scraping html.

Using the provided starter code, I created the file part_1_mars_MH.ipynb to work on the first deliverable of the assignment. This portion of the project was to scrape titles and preveiw text from news articles about Mars. I did this using BeautifulSoup to scrape and save the title and preview text for each article on the Mars webpage.

The second part of the assignment is in the file part_2_mars.ipynb. In this portion of the assignment I again used BeautifulSoup to scrape data, and this time I created a Pandas dataframe to store the scraped data. With this dataframe I analyzed Mars weather data and answered analysis questions with visualizations. I then exported the dataframe as a csv file (mars_data.csv).
